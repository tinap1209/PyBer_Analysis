# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Use of Matplotlib to produce publication-quality figures to tell a visual story about data about complex files that in a way engaging and simple to understand. In this module, we learned how to graph data using the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib has a rich set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame. we used Matplotlib to create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots, and make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors. You'll also be introduced to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. You'll use Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy to perform summary statistics.

## Results
It is very very evident from the results that The number of rides, drivers, fares, is more in urban cities than in semi-urban, and rural places. In the below image you can clearly see that Urban cities are way way more profitable than other city types.

## Summary
In my recommendation to the CEO, I would suggest that he would invest more into research and development to customize rides for the urban population. As we can see and understand that the suburban areas are slowly catching up they are however a long way to go. 
When we look at the rural rides and fares, it is very very helpful for market share and establishes a market presence without completely ignoring that market.Â
